# 🔐 Password Security Analyzer

A Python-based command-line tool that evaluates password strength using
entropy calculation, pattern detection, and dictionary-based checks.

This project simulates how basic password auditing tools work in
cybersecurity environments.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Entropy-based password strength evaluation
- Detection of weak password patterns
- Dictionary-based password checks
- Clear, human-readable security reports

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Modular package structure
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python3 main.py

password-security-analyzer/
│── main.py
│── checks/
│   ├── entropy.py
│   ├── patterns.py
│   ├── dictionary_check.py
│   └── __init__.py
└── data/
    └── common_passwords.txt
📌 Example Output
Password: HelloKitty123!
Entropy: 49.3 bits
Strength: STRONG

Patterns detected:
None

Dictionary Check:
Not found in common-password list

📚 Learning Goals

This project demonstrates:

Python module organization

Secure password evaluation techniques

Command-line application development

GitHub version control best practices

## ✅ After you commit the README

Refresh the repo page.  
You should see a **nice project description under the file list**.

At that point, this repo is **100% internship / resume ready**.

---

## 🧠 How YOU should describe this project (important)

Use this wording anywhere (resume, applications, interviews):

> **Password Security Analyzer (Python)**  
> Built a modular Python tool to evaluate password strength using entropy calculations, pattern detection, and dictionary-based analysis. Implemented a clean package structure and command-line interface to simulate real-world password auditing tools.

That sentence is GOLD.

## 🚀 What I recommend next (strategy, not pressure)

Since you said:
> *“no frontend, more coding/cyber”*

Your next *ideal* project should be **log analysis** or **security automation**, NOT UI.

But first — tell me:

### 👉 Have you added the README yet? (yes / no)

Once you say **yes**, I’ll help you choose the **next project** that complements this one perfectly so your GitHub doesn’t look random.
